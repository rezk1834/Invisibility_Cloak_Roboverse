# Roboverse Invisibility Cloak

## Description:
The Roboverse Invisibility Cloak project showcases a computer vision application built using OpenCV and Python. Inspired by fictional invisibility cloaks, this project demonstrates the ability to make objects seemingly disappear in real-time video streams.

## Features:
- **Color Detection:** Utilizes the HSV color space to detect specific colors in a live video stream.
- **Masking:** Applies a binary mask to isolate the detected color from the background.
- **Real-time Processing:** Performs color detection and masking in real-time, providing instantaneous feedback.
- **Customizable:** Easily customizable color ranges using a dictionary, allowing users to tailor the cloak's color to their preference.
- **Simple Interface:** Clean and concise codebase with comprehensive comments for easy understanding and modification.

## Usage:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/roboverse-invisibility-cloak.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python numpy
     ```

3. **Adjust Color Range (Optional):**
   - Open the `invisibility_cloak.py` file in a text editor.
   - Locate the `color_ranges` dictionary and adjust the HSV color ranges as needed.
   - You can customize the color range to match the color of the cloak you want to create.

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
   - Run the Python script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python invisibility_cloak.py
     ```

5. **Experiment with the Cloak:**
   - Once the script is running, your computer's webcam will activate, and you'll see the real-time video stream.
   - Hold up an object of the chosen color (e.g., a red cloth) in front of the webcam.
   - The script will detect the color and make the object appear invisible by replacing it with the background.

6. **Customization (Optional):**
   - Feel free to experiment with different colors by adjusting the color range in the code.
   - You can also modify the code to add additional features or enhance the functionality according to your preferences.

7. **Quit the Application:**
   - To exit the application, press the `Esc` key on your keyboard.
   - This will close the video stream window and terminate the script.

8. **Contribute (Optional):**
   - If you're interested in contributing to the project, you can fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests with your enhancements or bug fixes.

9. **Enjoy and Share:**
   - Have fun experimenting with your own invisibility cloak effect!
   - Feel free to share your experiences and any modifications you make to the project with the community.

These steps provide a guide for using the Roboverse Invisibility Cloak project to create your own invisibility effects in real-time video streams.
